I'm writing a book - but that's like the mid-level consultants. And I realized that

a) There should be a beginners guide
b) "Indie consulting" is becoming a label.

Link to a wiki post that will evolve and grow.

This should be done in a "docs" style layout:

Or a gitbooks version:

Something that has chapters, sections headings etc.

Should I build it on the threaducation model so there's room for reflection too?

Threaducation:
- Gives me the ability to iframe in other content
- Gives me the ability to test out reflection spaces
- Makes it more shareable and interesting

Maybe the best reflection space is at the beginning - Spend a few minutes reflecting on what you want.

Every page is a post on sepiabrown - but the container becomes it's own thing? Iframed in?
