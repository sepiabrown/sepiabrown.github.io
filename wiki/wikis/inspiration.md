Some personal wikis and sites that I've been inspired by:

[buster.wiki/](https://buster.wiki/) - Strong design and everything has a date by the looks of it which enables an RSS feed. Very polished and thought through.

[are.na](https://are.na) - A platform that all the cool kids use for building personal knowledge libraries. Lightly social, perhaps the right answer but slightly questionable if they'll be around for a long time. Ymmv.

[Brendan's /canon](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/) - this was part of the original inspiration for me. A curated list of pure stock - things that Brendan returns to again and again. He has a template you can copy too.

[Worrydream's quotes page](http://worrydream.com/#!/quotes) - just a massive list of interesting quotes collected by Brett Victor. Notice how being one giant page makes it instantly searchable.

[daywreckers.com](http://daywreckers.com/) - from Ben Pieratt, not quite a wiki but a very minimal site designed to collect the dots. A daily visit from me.

[derek sivers' daily journal](https://sivers.org/dj) - a post from Derek Sivers on how to keep a text-file long-term store for your ideas and notes.

And there's lots more too - [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sepiabrown/status/1083823277712248832) has a whole bunch of interesting rabbit holes.

Here's an interesting project from the NYT that uses gdocs as a backend to generate a wiki! [Library](https://open.nytimes.com/we-built-a-collaborative-documentation-site-deploy-your-own-with-the-push-of-a-button-134de99c42fc)

>Prior to the fellowship the research I did was spontaneous and infrequent enough that my ad hoc system of typing out highlights by hand into a one or more markdown files and sorting through them manually worked alright. But now that I'm dealing with many, many more pages of research, this system has become kind of unwieldy.

>Here I'll go over the tools I've built over the past couple years (most within the past year) to make this process more manageable. They are mostly meant to address a few key pain points:
>
>Aggregating highlights from across several platforms (phone, desktop, and eReader) into a central repository
>Capturing charts and other graphics
>Tagging and organizing highlights
>Generating footnotes
