Education, teaching & learning increasingly powers everything I work on.

Consulting is education: teaching clients how to do things.

Every consulting client is an education for the consultant.

Brand marketing hinges on educational experiences for users.

In-context, edutainment, powerful education and learning moments.

[Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) - learning essay format

<https://education-trails.glitch.me/> - this is a stupid little prototype I built to show how a "guided learning" UX could look and feel like. I quite quickly abandoned this because I think it's an evolutionary dead end (too forced for one thing). The one idea I did like here is using Chrome local-storage to quickly and easily generate your own "side notes" or space for reflection and notes to self while reading which I think is a great deliberate practice for learning.

[twitter thread here shows my thinking and building process](https://twitter.com/sepiabrown/status/1139287898933665792)

TODO: a prototype similar to the above from the opposite end of the spectrum i.e. entirely self directed instead of forced linear learning. What would that look like?
