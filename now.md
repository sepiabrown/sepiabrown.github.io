Location: Brooklyn, NY.

Here's what I'm up to right now.

- I run an independent consulting studio where I work with senior executives on a mixture of coaching, consulting and innovation. Typically I'm working with digital media companies like the New York Times, Dotdash and Gartner but I also work with a variety of smaller startups on smaller projects and coaching. [More here](https://tomcritchlow.com/consulting/).
- I'm [writing a book](https://sepiabrown.github.io/strategy/) about the practice of independent consulting. Less a "how to" book and more a project to support indies, freelancers and weirdos build long term sustainable consulting practices. Hopefully publishing late 2023.
- Teaching executive presence skills via my [SEO MBA](https://seomba.com) brand. With 10k+ subscribers and two courses available to purchase this is a fun new adventure into the world of professional education, teaching and course creating.
- Early days building a new venture (codename: NEW MBA) designed to teach foundational business, communication and entrepreneurship skills. If I design this well it'll be the next 5-10 years of research focus, writing, time and energy. It's the culmination and intersection of my teaching and writing over the past 5 years.
- My daughter is 7 and my son is 3.5 and they're wacky weirdos and I love em.
- Getting back into rock climbing at the Cliffs in Gowanus.
- Oddly - the art business I run with Erin [Fiercely Curious](https://www.fiercelycurious.com/) is busy right now... Mulling ways to extend and evolve the business for the next decade.
