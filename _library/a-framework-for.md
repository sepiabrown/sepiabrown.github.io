A framework for writing online. This is a nice short video from David Perell

I especially like the ABCD framework for feedback. Asking specifically:

* A - What's awesome?
* B - What's boring?
* C - What's confusing?
* D - What didn't you believe?

That last one is key - writing is so much better when you strengthen the foundations and address people's assumptions directly.
