I love this one from Linus on how we might create more of a community or field of research in the "tools for thought" space

[thesephist.com/posts/res...](https://thesephist.com/posts/research-community/)

I too dislike the phrase and framing of "tools for thought" but don't have something better.

Wouldn't it be neat to make a hub for this research? Like an RSS feed aggregator and links out to various projects...? Something kind of like newmodels.io?
