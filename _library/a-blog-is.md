"A blog is always good enough" - lovely

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Useful" data-author="Russell Davies" cite="https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2022/03/useful.html">
<p>I've recently wondered whether I could just dispense with the coffee stuff and share the whole collection in some useful way. And I've been wondering how to get it all together. I tried <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrivener</a>, so it could be a book and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roam</a>, so it could be networked and modern and <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian</a>, so it could look like a spaceship. But none of them seemed to stick.</p>
<p>I even tried building webpages festooned with links and tags like I was building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xanadu</a>, but I've <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read about that</a>.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>And then, the other day I found myself saying to someone "<em>Just do it as a blog, it's never exactly what you want, but it's always good enough.</em>" And that reminded me of these lines from <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/6364/9781785043710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Change by Katy Milkman</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>In psychology, there’s something called the “saying-is-believing effect.” Thanks to cognitive dissonance, after you say something to someone else, you’re more likely to believe it yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>So I'm going to saying-is-believing myself and just stick stuff on here, collect it all together and add thoughts it I have them. And then we'll sort it all out later. A blog is always good enough.</p>
