The connection between walking and attention....

<p>There are places in-between the spaces we live. We rarely “see” them, but they are there.</p>



<p>I’ve realized many of my favourite writers, video makers, and photographers are constantly exploring this space in-between. They travel and then observe the space between where they start and finish. Their destination doesn’t matter, it is someplace you’ve never heard of. It is about the journey through the in-between. You might enjoy their work too—they include <a href="https://intellectualinting.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Arnade</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bald and Bankrupt</a>, <a href="https://craigmod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craig Mod</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoWizard (Tom Davies)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm325cMiw9B15xl22_gr6Dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beau Miles</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXwMqnXfJzazKS5fJ8nrVw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiey</a> and more.</p>



<p>Where they go and what they see isn’t “normal.” It is not big cities or popular attractions. For Bald and Bankrupt, it is an obscure historical Soviet site. For GeoWizard, it is the endpoint on a straight line across a whole country. For Craig Mod, it is a small cafe along a Japanese walking route. They do a lot of walking. As the slowest form of transportation, this allows them to do something special: observe.</p>
