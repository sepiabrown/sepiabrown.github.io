Lots of energy right now around grants.

Growing up, I've always been mesmerized by people I perceived to be “moths” — humans fluttering around just outside of the bright glow of the traditional spotlight. While “butterflies” sparkled within traditional systems, moths seemed to be playing games entirely of their own making. I believe both human and insect moths are frequently underestimated. They're just as smart as butterflies (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/19/145532/why-even-a-moths-brain-is-smarter-than-an-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or an AI</a>, for that matter), <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/464151/Incredible-pictures-show-close-ups-of-moth-wings-looking-like-kaleidoscope-of-colours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beautifully complex up-close</a>, and driven by a magical intrinsic force: agency.&nbsp;

Reminds me of Nadia's helium grants program:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Advice%20on%20starting%20a%20microgrant%20program" data-author="Nadia Eghbal" cite="https://nadiaeghbal.com/microgrants">
<p>I ran a personal microgrant program called <a href="https://www.heliumgrant.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helium Grants</a> for two years. After reading ~4,000 applications and awarding nearly $40,000 in grants to 26 people, I’ve decided to put it on indefinite hiatus and focus on other projects.</p>

<p>Since starting Helium, I’ve gotten questions about how to start a microgrant program, so I figured I’d capture my learnings in one place. Some of this advice overlaps with previous posts I’ve written; this one is my best attempt at a cheat sheet.</p>

I'd love to start a micro-grant program to get people zero -> one for blogging. How to encourage people to start a (small b) blogging habit.......?
