<span>The present research examines the causal relationship between specific curiosity and creativity.

Some interesting insights from this:

1. Maintaining an active list of "open questions" might make you more creative. Is there a way to reframe your general interests into a list of questions? I did something a bit like that with my [areas of inquiry](https://sepiabrown.github.io/2022/01/06/jan-22-map-inquiry/) post recently
2. Doing things leads to questions leads to creativity leads to doing things.... There's a nice virtuous cycle here where finding specific problems - i.e. specific questions leads you into a positive cycle of curiousity and creativity...

Update: I wonder if there's value in a little tool/prompt/exercise that encourages people to convert their general, abstract interest into a set of active questions. I have a hunch that if you can push people into a question mindset they can be more focused, more creative, less distracted and more likely to spend time on their interests....
