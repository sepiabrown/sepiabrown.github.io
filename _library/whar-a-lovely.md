What a lovely phrase:

Careful attention results in output

Thinking in terms of input/output I always return to this meditation from Derek Sivers:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Seeking inspiration? | Derek Sivers" data-author="Derek Sivers" cite="https://sive.rs/io">
<p>The word “inspiration” usually means “something that mentally stimulates you.”</p><p>But “inspiration” also means to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inspiration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breathe in</a>.</p><p>The meanings poetically combine when you think of yourself breathing in thoughts, filling your body with ideas. <strong>But don’t forget to breathe out.</strong></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><strong>Because nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work. </strong><em>(“work” meaning your life’s output, whether creative, business, or personal).</em><br></p><p>In other words, your work, itself, is the inspiration.</p>

Breathe in. Breathe out.
