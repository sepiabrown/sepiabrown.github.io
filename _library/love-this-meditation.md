Love this meditation on note taking and expertise in ill-structured domains...

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="How%20Note%20Taking%20Can%20Help%20You%20Become%20an%20Expert" data-author="@commoncog" cite="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-note-taking-can-help-you-become-an-expert/">
<p>CFT asserts that due to this nature of ill-structured domains, cases are <em>as</em> if not <em>more</em> important than concepts. This second idea is a more subtle one, so we’re going to spend a bit of the time examining the implications.</p><p>I think many of us have been exposed to a particular style of teaching in school, where we are taught a concept, and then the examples that illustrate that concept are treated as disposable. My go-to example for this is how we are taught quadratic equations — we are shown one or two examples and then we are expected to memorise the general approach for solving such equations. As a result of this instruction, many of us internalise that concepts are important and examples are not.</p>
