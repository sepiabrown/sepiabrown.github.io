Amen to this! Google Photos can identify all QR codes in my library via incredibly fancy machine learning. And yet I need to swipe up, then tap then tap again to click on a QR code. Why can't you just click a QR code in the camera roll?

(Hey Apple: what I wish I could do is tap on a QR code in a photo in my photo library, which it seems like I canâ€™t? Because then I could save photos of all these posters and make my own ad hoc deeplink homescreen as a photo album on my phone, and share it with my family.)
