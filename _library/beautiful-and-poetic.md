Beautiful and poetic:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Fieldnotes%20for%20Design%20%E2%80%93%20Charis%20Poon" data-author="" cite="https://charispoon.com/project/fieldnotes-for-design/">
<p>Fieldnotes encompass more than drawing, and as we use fieldnotes ourselves, our understanding of what they are and how others might use this method, develops.</p>
<p>We start our series of <em>Fieldnotes for Design</em> with drawing &amp; sketching. Further editions explore mapping, writing, data collecting, sound recording and the field itself.&nbsp;<em>Fieldnotes for Design Volume 1: On drawing and sketching</em> has been self-published in a small run.</p>
<p>Our approach is poetic; it relies on unexpectedness, happenstance, gesturing and evoking, rather than pointing and telling. We expect our readers to skip, dip, sigh, tut, smile, shuffle skim, muse and shift between our pages, producing a cacophony of responses.</p>
