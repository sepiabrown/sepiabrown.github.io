<p>I think a lot about blogging, about why I like it, what I think I can accomplish through blogging that I can’t accomplish, or not easily anyway, through other kinds of writing … and that leads me to metaphors. For instance, I have appropriated from Brian Eno and others the distinction between architecture and gardening, and <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-blog-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have described my blog as a kind of garden</a>. But lately I’ve been revisiting the architecture/gardening distinction and I have come to think that there <em>is</em> something architectural about writing a blog, or can be – but not in the sense of a typical architectural project, which is designed in advanced and built to specifications.
