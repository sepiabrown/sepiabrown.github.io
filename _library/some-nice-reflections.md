Some nice reflections on working at Github - I especially love this meditation on working on a big project that got cancelled:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Six%20Things%20I%20Learned%20in%20Six%20Years%20at%20GitHub" data-author="" cite="http://sophieshepherd.com/six-years/">
<p>My first takeaway here is to always look at product decisions through this lens of time. Why is this important now? What else is happening in the product or with competitors that could hinder this? Are we putting too much effort into this too soon?</p>

<p>My second takeaway is to rethink the concept of shipping all together. We sometimes put too much importance on shipping, when deciding not to do something is often the harder, and smarter, decisionâ€”and should be celebrated. With so much weight on shipping The Big Thing, we forget how important it is to work incrementally. If it felt like we threw a lot of work away, did we bite off more than we could chew?</p>

<p>And last, it has taught me the importance of storytelling, documentation, and leaving a record of your work. People come and go from companies, but good ideas remain. Leaving time capsules of your thinking and learnings will ensure that your ideas live on.</p>
