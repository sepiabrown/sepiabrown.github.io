Mmm. Gotta spend some time diving into this idea:

<p><strong>Paul Soulellis: </strong>We’re doing that all the time, whenever we circulate anything. “<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ic48qw90632zrvp/warnerPubCounterP.pdf?dl=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Publics and Counterpublics</a>” by Michael Warner, do you know that piece?</p><p><strong>LG: </strong>I’m vaguely familiar.</p><p><strong>PS: </strong>That’s been huge for me. The ideas he sketches out there go beyond publishing, to addressivity and acts of speech. In the past I used to think about publishing, and I think many people still do, as the production of objects. Like: you make a zine, you make a digital file, you make a book. I guess one thing that changed for me with Michael Warner's [piece] was the idea of setting something into motion and forming a public through its circulation, and through the discourse that's created around that movement.</p><p>I started thinking about publishing in gestural and performative ways where that action, when you make objects move—sometimes literally physically moving from hand to hand or library to library et cetera, or on the network from server to sever—that is where the public, or a public, or multiple publics are being formed. That can happen with anything.</p>
