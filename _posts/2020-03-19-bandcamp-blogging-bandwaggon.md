title: Announcing- The Bandcamp Blogging Bandwagon
subtitle: Supporting indie artists on Bandcamp Friday March 20th
---

In these times we need cozy blogging structures and we need support for independents more than ever. So I'm combining these to launch a little blogging project.

[Bandcamp is doing something wonderful](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser). Friday March 20th:

>**To raise even more awareness around the pandemic’s impact on musicians everywhere, we’re waiving our revenue share on sales this Friday, March 20 (from midnight to midnight Pacific Time), and rallying the Bandcamp community to put much needed money directly into artists’ pockets.**
>
>For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not. Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come, so we’re also sharing some ideas below on how fans can support the artists they love and how artists can give fans new, creative ways to provide support.

## Blogging your Bandcamp Reccs

So I'm putting out a rallying cry - let's start a [#BandcampBloggingBandwagon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BandcampBloggingBandwagon&src=typed_query) and Friday March 20th let's all post our fave bandcamp links.

This directly helps folks discover great Bandcamp music so they can spend their money and support indie artists in this time of need.

It's that simple. Leave a comment below or tag me on twitter [@sepiabrown](https://twitter.com/sepiabrown) and I'll do my best to keep track of all the reccs as they come in.

Indie Blogging + Indie music + Community support.

You can simply link to your faves or embed them too. Here's one of my recent faves (more tomorrow!):

Let's do it. See you tomorrow.

Much love.

*Update: there's a great service [buymusic.club](https://buymusic.club/) that makes it super easy to make lists of Bandcamp music and embed it so this is a great way to join in if you don't have a blog!*
