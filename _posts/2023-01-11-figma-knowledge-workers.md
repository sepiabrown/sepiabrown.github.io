Nate Kadlac runs [Approachable Design](https://www.approachabledesign.co/) an online course to teach the basics of visual aesthetic and design.

I run the [SEO MBA](https://seomba.com/) an online course to teach SEO professionals executive presence.

Together we're cooking up a new project - and we're going to build it in public. Why? Why not!

**Update: the weekly recurring working session is here: <https://lu.ma/figma-for-kw>**

The project is very early but the basic pitch is this:

**Figma for Knowledge Workers - an online course to teach a pragmatic basic grounding in Figma for product managers, consultants, creators and folks who can do more effective and more creative work by learning to work with Figma.**

Listen, the project is still in the concept phase. But if you want to join Nate and I tomorrow we'll be building it all in public.

Figma is a magnificent product. I'm not a designer but as an independent consultant, creator and blogger I spend probably more than 50% of my time in Figma working visually. Concepting, giving feedback, and creating visual assets.
