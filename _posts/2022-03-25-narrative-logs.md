When you know where you're going it's easy to navigate. When you don't know where you're going... well obviously steering is a bit harder?

That's why [working with the garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) or [thinking in public](https://sepiabrown.github.io/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) is a powerful tool for research projects, startups and new ventures.

I've long been inspired by Matt Webb's weeknotes from Berg - if you're not familiar he talks about them in his [pre-history of weeknotes](https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes):

My habit at BERG, for some years, was to go to the studio on Saturday mornings and reflect on the week. One of my most rambling, longest, personally-most-enjoyable weeknotes was <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2011/06/21/week-315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Week 315</a> and it came from a morning like that. It’s a series of notes of whatever was on my mind, and word-sketches about studio life.

As I begin to transition into running the [SEO MBA](https://seomba.com/) as my full-time thing, my daily and weekly rhythms are all new. The tempo and cadence of building a course is very different from doing client consulting work and I'm still adjusting and finding my feet.

So I've started up something between a ship's log and weeknotes, the [SEO MBA log](https://seomba.com/log/):

I don't need another blog place to write, but I am enjoying keeping a record of what I did, how I felt and what happened. It's as much for me as anyone else. I don't know where I'm going but the least I can do is show where I've been.

It's already useful - for example I can see that it took me about 3 weeks between [starting to shoot video](https://seomba.com/log/#2021-10-11) and the [course being live](https://seomba.com/log/#2021-11-03).

The design and format was inspired by [Doubleloop](https://doubleloop.app) which is a kind of tool for documenting and creating narratives around strategy. They've pivoted slightly away from the initial product but I love their [public changelog idea](https://app.doubleloop.app/p/DoubleLoop/440).

Maybe if you're working on a project and don't have a clear idea of where you're going but want to increase your surface area for serendipity you should consider some kind of weeknotes/ships log.

After all, if [blogging is all about boat stories](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/01/09/boat-stories/) then you need a ships log:

> We of the twenty-first century are bloggers first, and book writers second. We don’t do dragons or carrier bags. We do boats.
