I've been thinking a lot about margin notes recently[^yes].

[^yes]: Yes, like this!

For a few years now I've had hypothesis installed on my site (try it, just highlight any text and tap "annotate"!). It's kind of like Google Docs in-line comments but for the web. The UX is a little clunky - especially on mobile and I get very few comments that way but I always enjoy them when I do.

Meanwhile:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My latest blog post had 70+ comments in google docs during the draft/editing phase. The web version feels so flat by comparison. I wish there was a way to create that kind of vibrancy on the web.</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1337111609383088129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

How do we bring this level of interactivity to the web? Comments at the end of the page feel stale and web 1.0. How do we bring in-line, interactive comments to the web?

I also use side-notes[^side] for call-outs and, mostly, snark. They're inspired by Tufte CSS and I write them in pure markdown by using footnotes and then rendering them in JS on the page as side-notes.

[^side]: Like this! Hi again.

Read more about that tech here [a new simpler approach to margin notes](https://sepiabrown.github.io/2020/03/16/new-blogging-3/#a-new-simpler-approach-to-margin-notes).

Then I found this 8,000 word monster[^monster] from Gwern all about sidenotes on the web, with various technological solutions outlined which is just a stunning tour de force:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Sidenotes%20In%20Web%20Design" data-author="Gwern Branwen" cite="https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes">
<h1>Sidenotes In Web Design</h1>
<p>
In typography/design, â€˜sidenotesâ€™ place footnotes/endnotes in the margins for easier reading. I discuss design choices, HTML implementations and their pros/cons.</p>

</blockquote>
<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

And then I saw this - wonderful, weird, basically un-usable whismy floating glowing side notes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">very into these floating footnotes and asterisks <a href="https://t.co/Oys2EGtySX">https://t.co/Oys2EGtySX</a></p>&mdash; Meg Miller (@Megilllah) <a href="https://twitter.com/Megilllah/status/1339587519197810689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Where am I going with this? I'm not sure. Marginalia and commenting has been tried a million different ways on the web but I'm still not convinced that we've cracked it. Who's doing interesting things in this space?
