Back in February of this year I realized that this blog could be more than a blog - that by virtue of being a static site I can maintain a local files+folders structure and use that to publish my own personal wiki to the web.

More on all of that in the original post here: [building a digital garden](https://sepiabrown.github.io/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/).

Then a few weeks ago I came across [Screenotate](https://screenotate.com/). It's a dead simple mac app that saves all your screenshots as web-pages on your computer with URL of the page saved, meta-data and OCR-text of the screenshot. See it in action here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⭐️ I&#39;m releasing Screenotate 2.0, my Mac/Windows screenshot+OCR+context app: <a href="https://t.co/K8guHxQZZW">https://t.co/K8guHxQZZW</a><br>When you take a screenshot, it recognizes text inside + the originating URL, then saves it as a self-contained HTML file for later search <a href="https://t.co/a27bdWwA6K">pic.twitter.com/a27bdWwA6K</a></p>&mdash; Omar Rizwan (@rsnous) <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/933090180969279488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This set off a lightbulb in my head. What if I can use screenotate to save new kinds of files - HTML snapshots of pages. Image+meta-data+text. Perfect. Archive-friendly and shareable screenshots that take two seconds to save into my personal wiki. Perfect.

And so that's what I did.

For an example - take a look at this Pedagogy wiki I just started building:

[/wiki/pedagogy](https://sepiabrown.github.io/wiki/pedagogy/)

And for the lazy, here's a [direct link to a screenshot HTML file saved by Screenotate](https://sepiabrown.github.io/wiki/pedagogy/Screenshot%202019-06-13%20at%202.08.13%20PM.html).

It's become my default mode for capturing snippets and shoving them into my wiki. Nice.

To extend the wiki-as-garden metaphor I feel like I've begun planting a new kind of varietal (page) into my garden (wiki). Thanks Omar!

*Note: I'm embedding the Screenotate files as iframes at the moment which... is probably not the best idea. Large images also don't work very well in a small iframe window. I tried using the CSS scale property to show a thumbnail property but run into the limits of my CSS skills. Anyway - what I'm saying is it's a work in progress and likely not perfectly coded...*
